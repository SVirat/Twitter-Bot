# Twitter Bot

A twitter bot that tweets certain information every day, such as free eBooks currently available, a quote, daily stock information, and some events which took place on this day some years ago. It also retweets and favorites some other popular tweets based on hashtag, location, and user.

The bot scraps the web to get the information, and utilizes BeautifulSoup to read the information properly. It utilizes multiprocessing to run all these operations concurrently.

This particular Twitter bot is active on RobotBird, @ASCIIBird: https://twitter.com/ASCIIBird.
